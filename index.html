						<h3>Centre for Peace and Illumination @Kanpur</h3>
						<p>We at the Centre for Peace & Illumination, have been working for the last over a decade, spreading the teachings of Maha Atma Choa Kok Sui and accordingly the awareness of Energy as a medium for the attainment of Good Health and Well Being.</p>			
						<p>Energy Healing as propounded by Him, is now referred to as Yoga Prana Vidya or YPV in short and through a Three Course curriculum, can be learnt by anyone of Mature Age, Average Intelligence and the Willingness to Learn and Practice something new.</p>		
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12 about-info" >
						<p>Y P V  enables a practitioner to deal with all types of afflictions, be they Physical, Emotional or Psychological, either as Complimentary to Orthodox Medicine or even as an Independent Modality when no form of medication or therapy is indicated.</p>
						<p>These three courses are taught by us over a period of Five days and the technology is so designed by Maha Atma, that anyone who goes through it can practice YPV to a fair degree of proficiency.
								Maha Atma Choa Kok Sui also emphasizes the Importance of Meditation and has gifted the world with the “Planetary Meditation  for Peace” for bringing about Peace & Illumination. Everyone who practices this meditation, experiences a heightened sense of inner calmness and composure, enabling clarity in thought, harmony in relationships, increased ability to comprehend and memorise.
								All of this results in higher efficiency and leads to us becoming successful in our life’s endeavours.
								We at the Centre for Peace & Illumination, observed over the years of our work, that there was a necessity for a curtain raiser to  this Science and Art of Energy Healing.
								Being an exercise in the subtle reality, many found it difficult to comprehend and also many had superstitious beliefs about it , so we put together a simple and effective curriculum called, Arogya Shakti - A Well Being Session.</p>
						<p>Arogya Shakti - A Well Being Session happens for One and a Half hour everyday for 5 to 7 days  as the situation and group deems fit, preferably in the morning hours, from where the participants go directly to their stations in life, be it their School, Office, Business Place or Home.
								They now experience the sustained effect of the Energy practices they have gone through in the early part of the morning and in the Practical reality, see the efficacy of it in their everyday work and life throughout the day. This gives them the opportunity to decide, on when they should begin their study and practice of all that Maha Atma Choa Kok Sui, so generously has offered in a simple to learn methodology. However, if for some reason they cannot embark on it right away, they may opt to partake of the benefits, of Healing and Meditation from those who have already qualified to do so.
								Arogya Shakti – A well Being Session incorporates, a motivational talk, Planetary Meditation for Peace and Yoga Prana Vidya for every individual participant, with specific emphasis on their personal Medical Condition, every day of those 5 to 7 days as the case may be, participants have reported great shifts in their conditions of Health and Well Being.
								All that we have narrated here are the preliminary few Courses and Practices that our beloved Teacher Maha Atma Choa Kok Sui has made available, apart from which, He has empowered us to teach and conduct Courses and Practices relevant to the various aspects of our lives, like Stress Management, Brain Power Workout , Energetic, Self Defence, Awakening the Light Within, Kriya  Shakti  ,The Path to Arahatship and the like.
								All of these add up to, us gaining a greater understanding of the Universal Laws that govern the various aspects of life and so enabling us act appropriately, take proper and accurate decisions and in so doing, achieve Success, Progress and Prosperity.</p>
						<p>We would invite you to look at the possibility of your Organisation benefiting from these Energy Techniques and it would be our endeavour to guide you through, what would be the most appropriate manner to begin with and how to take it forward to its logical end, of a heightened sense of Well Being, Good Health and Successful & Effective Living.</p>

					<h3>About Maha Atma Choa Kok Sui</h3>
					<p>Maha Atma Choa Kok Sui is the Founder and Originator of the Pranic Healing® and Arhatic Yoga® System, as well as the internationally acclaimed author of the book, Miracles Through Pranic Healing (3rd Edition). Originally published in 1987 as The Ancient Science and Art of Pranic Healing, Maha Atma Choa conceptualized a fresh and far deeper understanding of energy healing, using the readily available source of all life - Prana, called Pranic Energy or Vital Life Force.</p>
					<p>Maha Atma Choa not only conceived the comprehensive techniques designed to cleanse and energize the physical body, thereby accelerating the rate at which the body can heal itself, he even originated new, never before used terms, to thoroughly clarify the concepts he devised. Maha Atma Choa successfully has demonstrated that energy is an important factor in healing the physical body, and through employing Pranic Psychotherapy®, also in healing the psyche.</p>
